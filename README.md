#Workshop projects for spring-boot

###Starting state: 
The simple spring-boot default sample controller. Dense and hard to get magics.

###Phase 1: Bringing the hammer down
Breaking up the sample controller into smaller parts to show what each component is doing in the springframework.

###Phase 2: Persistance is Magic
Adding some other springframework dependencies, specifially spring-data-jpa for persistence.

###Phase 3: Acend to RMM Level 3
Adding spring-hateoas to make our API RMM level 3
